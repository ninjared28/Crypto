#
# This strategy provides a bare bones set of settings from which you can start to explore the
# world of automated trading with ProfitTrailer. These settings have all the standard protection
# mechanisms built into them and all the basic settings you will need to get started.
#
# It uses a lower initial purchase price of approx. $20 with a large maximum trading pairs value to
# load up the queue of potential trading pairs to be scalped.
#
# This is a scalping strategy that aims to be in and out of trades as quickly as possible (depending
# upon prevailing market conditions at the time) taking small profits along the way.
#
# It looks for pairs that are in their LOWBB range and with low RSI indicating they are overbought.
#
# If a trade starts to fail it tries to recover it using both DCA and Pending Orders features to increase
#
# If a trading pair starts to fail it tries to recover it quickly with DCA to 5 levels so maximum exposure
# per trading pair is approx. $120 in normal circumstances. When a trade starts to fail your exposure may
# be greater as it uses dollar cost averaging to try and recover the pair and Pending Orders which will
# increase position sizes when combined with new purchases of the same trading pair.
#
# The DCA trigger is set at -1 and uses LOSS to do the buys to ensure we are actually recducing the combined
# average cost of the trading pair. The LOSS is combined with a 10 minute rebuy timeout to ensure we are
# buying at the lowest possible price. The use of LOSS also prevents us purchasing more of a trading pair
# if the trading pair starts to rise in value again as doing so (positive DCA) would put us back into a
# loss situation which the trading pair may not recover from.
#
# Pending Orders are created if the trading pair continues to fail and goes below -5%.
#
# This is a beginner level strategy that will work in all market conditions.
